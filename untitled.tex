    This paper provides the first community-scale analysis of remixing behavior in online maker communities. Our analysis shows that authors of 3D designs on Thingiverse do not remix as frequently or draw from as many sources as those in online audio communities like ccMixter. We also characterized the impact of parametric design tools like Customizer, which provide lightweight ways of producing generated designs. We find that Customizer falls short of traditional definitions of remixing, in that generated designs do not elicit subsequent user activity and relatively few authors create both generated designs and original ones.
